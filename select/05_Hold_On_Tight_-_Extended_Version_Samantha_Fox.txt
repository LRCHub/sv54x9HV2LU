Okay this is it
Hold on tight!
Well since you told me

Yes
I'm out of control
We're gonna rock this town

Gonna watch it rattle and roll
Hold on honey
Hold on tight!
It's only money and tonight's the night

In answer to your question - just a hold on tight.

Well I'm in a whirl
A lucky girl
Who's found her only treasure

Being without you
Thinking about you
Has been my one and only plea
I made my mind up
Set my sights

I followed you morning
Noon and night

And since you put my lonely life to flight - hold on tight.

Hold on
Hold on tight
Me and you're flying to heaven tonight.
Hold on
Hold on tight
Me and my sweet
A little dynamite.
Hold on
Hold on tight
I've waited for you all of my life.
Hold on
Hold on tight

Don't let go
Just a hold
Just a hold on tight.

Well the dream machine is rolling now
You're on board

We're paradise bound
Never got that far before

Me and you honey
We're two of a kind

We're heading for heaven in a vertical climb

In answer to your question - just a hold on tight.

Well I'm in a whirl
A lucky girl . . .
Hold on
Hold on tight

Me and you're flying to heaven tonight. . . .

I made my mind up
Set my sights

I followed you morning
Noon and night

And since you put my lonely life to flight - hold on tight.
Hold on
Hold on tight

Me and you're flying to heaven tonight. . . .

Hold on
Hold on tight

Me and you're flying to heaven tonight.
Hold on
Hold on tight

Don't let go
Just a hold
Just a hold on tight.
