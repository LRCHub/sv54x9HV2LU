Make a me feel right
You gotta rock me give me shivers tonight
You gotta hold on tight and don't let go
Treat a me real nice
You gotta kiss me when you turn out the lights
You gotta hold on tight and don't let go

Don't leave don't make me lonely
Don't say goodbye
If you don't love a me only
Our love will die

Say that say that you love me
Tell me you're mine
I pray to heaven above me
True love will shine
