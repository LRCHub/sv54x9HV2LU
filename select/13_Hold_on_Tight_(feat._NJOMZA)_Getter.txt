It's in the air
Attention is thick like that
Look at me like you feel the rush
You want a ride, I'll make you mine
Show you the road, you're in my zone
I can take you to a secret place
You're the one that can get a taste
You want a ride, I'll make you mine
I'll show you the road
Listen to me when I say
I can make it all okay
Baby, take your pain away
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
We fly in on higher planes
Disappear into the haze
Losing track of night and day
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
Listen to me, when I say
I can make it all okay
Listen to me, when I say
I can make it all okay
Don't you dare, ever second guess this love
Got enough, I won't give this up
You want a ride, I'll make you mine
Show you the road, you're in my zone
I will do whatever it might take
To keep you here, I want you to stay
You want a ride, I'll make you mine
I'll show you the road
Listen to me when I say
I can make it all okay
Baby, take your pain away
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
We fly in on higher planes
Disappear into the haze
Losing track of night and day
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
Hold on tight, I'll pave the way
