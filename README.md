# aespa – Hold On Tight

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
(Maybe you & me
are a twisted fantasy
Buckle up and take a seat
hold on tight)
Situation critical, it's heavy
A million blocks of obstacles,
you help me
See a different POV
Giving back all my
Faith in a catastrophe
It's alright
Keep on moving
(moving)
Beat the system auto
pilot cruising
(cruising)
Tunnel vision victory no losing
(losing)
Heaven knows
it's one hell of a ride
Better hold on tight
Better hold on tight
For ya life
Maybe you & me
Are a twisted fantasy
Bodies running on a dream
Up all night
(all night)
Wired differently
A chaotic energy
Buckle up and take a seat
Hold on tight
(on tight)
We were built to be 2 enemies
(i know i know)
But somehow I know
we're meant to be
(i know i know)
This World's a battlefield,
I will be your shield
We got something real
Worth disrupting the peace
(we'll disrupt the peace)
(Ah-ah ah)
Yeah, Keep on moving
(moving)
Beat the system auto
pilot cruising
(cruising)
Tunnel vision victory no losing
(losing)
Heaven knows
it's one hell of a ride
Better hold on tight
Better hold on tight
For ya life
Maybe you & me
Are a twisted fantasy
Bodies running on a dream
Up all night
(all night)
Wired differently
A chaotic energy
Buckle up and take a seat
Hold on tight
For ya life
Maybe You & me
Are a twisted fantasy
Bodies running on a dream
Up all night
(all night)
Wired differently
A chaotic energy
Buckle up and take a seat
Hold on tight (on tight)
La la la la, la la la, la la la,
la la la, la la la
Hold on tight
(Hold on tight)
La la la la, la la la, la la la,
la la la, la la la
Hold on tight
